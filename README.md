# Tutorial: How to use GF grammars from another program

This repository contains code examples to complement (blog post:(TODO:write said blog post)). For general introduction, here's the intro of the blog post.

> This post will show how to use GF grammars from an external program, and how to manipulate GF trees from that program.
> The topic is introduced in [Lesson 7](http://www.grammaticalframework.org/doc/tutorial/gf-tutorial.html#toc143) of the tutorial, and I will cover parts that I find missing in the tutorial:

> * Installation, other practicalities of the GF ecosystem
> * Linguistically motivated example of tree manipulation
> * Examples in both Haskell and Python (the examples are the same, so only knowing one is enough)
