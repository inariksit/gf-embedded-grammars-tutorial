## Support for dependent types in different tools

```haskell
abstract Nat = {
  flags startcat = Span ;
  cat
    Span ;               -- for testing
    Nat ;                -- natural number
  data
    Zero : Nat ;         -- 0
    Succ : Nat -> Nat ;  -- the successor of x

  -- Proof objects generated by functions LessZ and LessS
  cat Less Nat Nat ;
  fun LessZ : (y : Nat) -> Less Zero (Succ y) ;
  fun LessS : (x,y : Nat) -> Less x y ->
                               Less (Succ x) (Succ y) ;

  -- Span is from a smaller number to a larger number
  fun FromTo : (m,n : Nat) -> Less m n -> Span ;
}
```

### Haskell runtime

See the file `TestHS.hs`, and run `stack run testHS` to see its output.

- generateAll works weirdly: only get the following and they have metavariables, even though linearization doesn't suppress any arguments
  ```
  3 — 4
  2 — 3
  1 — 2
  0 — 1
  ```
- generateFrom `FromTo ?1 ?2 ?3` works as expected, we get all 15 correct spans.
- Parsing (unary variant) works really weirdly: e.g. 0—5 works, but {1,2,3,4}—5 doesn't
- Parsing (decimal variant) is broken in a different way. No matter what we parse, it returns the trees for 0—{1,10}.


### C runtime

See the file `TestC.hs`, and run `stack run testC` to see its output.

No consideration for dependent types is taken. Generation produces 803 trees of depth 5, vs. the 15 correct spans that exist of that depth.

Parsing is weird and inconsistent, and also differently inconsistent with unary vs. decimal solutions.
